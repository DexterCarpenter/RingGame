# RingGame

Made by Dexter Carpenter

## Overview
An Arduino-based arcade style game. Press the button when the lights line up to proceed to a faster level. 

This was a one-day project. Using a Adafruit Neopixel ring (24), an Arduinio Uno, and a button I created a game where the objective is to press the button when the "runner" and the "selector" are aligned. If you are successful, you get a green flash and the runner gets faster. This proceeds until you miss, in which an animation plays and restarts the runner's speed.

My goal was to make this as simple as possible, using just the NeoPixel and a button as the UI.

Currently, I am working on migrating it off a breadboard to a custom circuit and a 3D-Printed case.

Below is my documentation on the project.
